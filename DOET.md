> I think it's intrinsically hard design struggles from being an iterative process. It's a field that shares a ton of similarities across all of its subdisciplines. Most game designers, and UI designers recommend you start out by reading the design of everyday things.

## [The Psychopathology of Everyday Things]

### Visibility

Naturally provide signals to indicate actions. These need not destory the aesthetics.

Natural signals -> Naturally interpreted -> "Natural Design"

Visibility indicates the mapping betweened intended actions and actual operations.
Visibility indicates crucial distinctions (ex: salt vs pepper)
Visibility of operation effects

Excess of visibility can also make things intimidating

The information available from the appearance of the objects - the psychology of everyday things

Affordance refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing.

Primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possible be used. (ex: Glass is for seeing through and for breaking.)

### Conceptual Models

Clues to how things work come from their visible structure and their

- Affordances
- Constraints
- Mappings

The scissors example:

The holes are affordances, to allow the fingers to be inserted.
The size of the holes provide constraints.
Mapping between holes and fingers, the set of possible operations, is suggested and constraitned by the holes.

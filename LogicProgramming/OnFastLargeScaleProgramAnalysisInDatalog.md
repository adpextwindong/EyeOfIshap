# [On Fast Large-Scale Program Analysis in Datalog](https://souffle-lang.github.io/pdf/cc.pdf)

To overcome or at least alleviate the challenges in program analysis,
Datalog [2–4, 8, 10, 25, 29, 34, 36, 37] has been employed as a
domain specific language (DSL). Program analyses can be expressed
concisely in Datalog reducing the complexity and making the
program analyses uniform such that they become interoperable
with each other. Note that Datalog has received renewed interest
in various computer science communities beside static program
analysis, including information extraction, networking, security, and
cloud computing as a DSL and a rapid-prototyping tool [15].

## Synthesizing from Datalog

Ullman has shown [35] that seminaïve evaluation is an efficient evaluation strategy.

# [An Introduction to Deductive Database Systems](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/50-years/journals/acj/ACJ-V15-N02-198305.pdf)

```
This section contains a brief introduction to logic programming. Much more complete discussions are given
by [Sammut and Sammut (1983b)](), [Clocksin and Mellish (1981)](), [Coelho et al. (1980)]() and [Kowalski (1979)](). A
collection of advanced papers is contained in [Clark and Tarnlund (1982)]().

How does the PROLOG interpreter compute an answer to a query? ... [it] can be _deduced_

The details of how this deduction is performed are
beyond the scope of this paper. The reader can find discussions in [Sammut and Sammut (1983a)](), [Kowalski (1979)]() and
[Lloyd (1982)]().

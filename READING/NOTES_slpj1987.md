# Intro

Implementing functional programming languages using _lazy graph reduction_

## 1.
- Translation from high level functional language into Lambda Calculus
- Pattern Matching
- Type Checking

## 2.
- Refinements and alternatives such as:
- Super Combinators
- Full laziness
- SK combinators

## 3.
- G-machine

The functional programming languages predating 1987:

- SASL [Turner, 1976](salsman.pdf)

- ML [Gorden et al., 1979](Gordon79_LectureNotesInComputerScience.pdf)

- KRC [Turner, 1982](turner82_RecursionEquations.pdf)

- Hope [Burstall et al., 1980](burstall80_Hope.pdf)

- Ponder [Fairbairn, 1985](Fairbairn75DesignAndImplementationOfASimpleTypedLanguageBasedOnTheLambdaCalculus.pdf)

- LML [Augustsson, 1984](augustsson84_ACompilerForLazyML.pdf)

- Miranda [Turner, 1985](turner85_Miranda.pdf)

- Orwell [Wadler, 1985](Wadler85_orwell.pdf)

Those with non strict semmantics being SASL, KRC, Ponder, LML, Miranda and Orwell.

ML and Hope being the strict languages in this group.

A super set of Lambda Calculus called _enriched lambda calculus_ will be used to specifically allow a straightfoward translation of a Miranda program into an expression in the enriched lambda calculus. This will be shown in chapter 3.

## Graph Reduction

```Haskell
f x = (x + 1) * (x - 1)
```

The expression `f 4` can be expressed as a tree of an application root with f and 4 as successors.

```
  @
 / \
f   4
```

Applying f to 4 yields

```
   *
 +    -
4 1  4 1
```

Executing the addition and subtration (in either order) gives

```
 *
5 3
```

Executing the last multiplication gives the result 15.

Evaluation of this tree (or more generally a graph) is done by a sequence of simple steps called reductions. Each reduction performing a local transformation of the graph (hence graphc reduction).

Reductions may safely take place in a variety of orders, even parallel, since they cannot interfere with each other.

When there are no further reducible expressions evaluation is completed.

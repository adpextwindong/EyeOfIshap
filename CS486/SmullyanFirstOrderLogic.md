# First Order Logic by Raymond Smullyan

## CH1 Preliminaries

```
The notion of tautology is perhaps the fundamental notion of propositional logic.

Definition: X is a tautology iff X is true in all Boolean valuations of E.

Equivalently X is a tautology iff X is true under every interpretation of E.
```

Let n be the numnber of variables which occur in X, there are exactly 2^n distinct interpretations of X.

Def 3. A fromula X is called (truth-functionally) satisfiable iff X is true in at least one Boolean valuation. A set S of formulas is said to be (simultaenously turth-functionally satisfiable iff there exists at least one Boolean valuation in which every element of S is true. Such a valuation is said to satisfy S.

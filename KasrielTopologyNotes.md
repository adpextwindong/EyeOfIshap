# CH1 Sets,Functions, and Relations

```
In elementary calculus, the definite integral from a to b is a functionwhose domain is the set of all real-valued functions that are Riemann integrable on the closed interval [a, b], and whose range is the set of all real numbers.
```

Side notes:
For example a non Riemann integrable function could be:

g(x) = { 1 if x is Rational,
         0 if x is Irrational } -- Dirichlet function
--This is Lebesgue integrable however

Exercises

The following exercises will assume that the sets involved are subsets of the real numbers.

1. List explicitly the elements of the set {x: x < 0 and (x - 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0}

{-2,-3}

2. List the elements of the following set. {x:3x - 1 is a multiple of 3}

{4/3 + x | x <- [1..]}

3. Sketch on a number line each of hte following sets.

{x:|x-1| <= 3}
[-2,4]

{x:|x - 1|<= 3 and |x| <= 2}
[-2,2]

{x:|x - 1| <= 3 or |x| <= 2}
[-2,4]
